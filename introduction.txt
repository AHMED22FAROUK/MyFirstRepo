# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Ahmed Farouk. I'm from Egypt and I'm passionate about technology, coding, and system engineering. I'm currently learning Linux commands and GitHub for DevOps and backend development.

Iâ€™m looking forward to using GitHub to collaborate on open source projects and improve my skills in system automation and software development.
